# Simulation of Airline Reservation System
Focus on: Linked Lists, Dynamic Memory Allocation, and Object Oriented Programming

# TASK:
Assume the Blue-Sky airlines use a linked list to maintain records for all passengers on its one and only flight.  This list has a node for each passenger and is maintained in alphabetical order by passenger name.  Each passenger node may contains the passenger name, passenger ID, reservation No, telephone number, seat number, and menu preference.  Possible transactions may include but not limited to:

| Status | Function Name          | functionality |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| Done   | Main menu              | Show transaction choices |
| Done   | Enter a reservation    | Add a passenger to the list |
| Done   | Cancel a reservation   | Delete a passenger from the list |
| Done   | Search for a passenger | Search for a special passenger.  If the passenger is found, then shows passenger's information otherwise prints "Not found". |
| Done   | Change a reservation   | Modify seat number and/or menu preference only.  __NOTE__: No seat number can be used more than once. |
| Done   | Print passenger list   | Prints all passengers information. |
| Done   | Produce reports        | Produces the menu report and check-in report. |
| Done   | Exit                   | Quits the program |
| Done   | Unqiue ID's            | Passenger ID, seat number, and reservation numbers are all unique |
| Done   | Sort list              | Sort the passenger list alpabetically |
| Done   | Documentation          | All documentation required for CS3003 standards and submission policies |
| Done   | Final Submission Ready | Ready for the final submission |

# Requirements
 1. You must use a linked list to store your costumer's information
 2. You must develop an algorithm and write your algorithm in pseudo code or flow diagram.
 3. Your program must produce a correct result if input is correct, otherwise an error message should be given.
 4. You must comment your program properly (including proper comments and program synopsis).  You may suffer up to 20% percent penalty if you failed to do so.
 5. You must put your functions and variables together to form a class - reservation.
 6. You need to turn your project on time; otherwise you will suffer a 10% deduction per day.
 7. You must write a makefile to compile your source code.
 8. You must include a design file [flow chart]
 9. You must include documentation on compiling the program.
 10. You must include include a readme file.
